  Orginally this trip was not a planned solo trip. The plan was for a group of
  friends to meet up for a week. That was until Disney added additional dates to
  the 21st Food and Wine Festival. This will be the longest festival to date. I
  decided to change my dates so that I could spend a few days enjoying the
  festival. This trip will be the best of both tavels. Spending a few days with
  friends and additional time exploring and enjoying Walt Disney World solo.

# Walt Disney World Fall 2016

Orginally this trip was not a planned solo trip. The plan was for a group of friends to meet up for a week. That was until Disney added additional dates to the 21st Food and Wine Festival. This will be the longest festival to date. I decided to change my dates so that I could spend a few days enjoying the festival. This trip will be the best of both tavels. Spending a few days with friends and additional time exploring and enjoying Walt Disney World solo.

Yes, I do enjoy Disney solo.
