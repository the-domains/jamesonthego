  Orginally the trip was not a solo trip. A group of friends were planning on
  meeting up for a week. Disney added additional dates to the 21st Food and Wine
  Festival. This will be the longest festival to date. I decided to change my
  dates so that I could spend a few days at enjoying the festival. This trip
  will be the best of both tavels. Spending a few days with friends and
  additional time exploring and enjoying Walt Disney World solo.

# Walt Disney World Fall 2016

Orginally the trip was not a solo trip. A group of friends were planning on meeting up for a week. Disney added additional dates to the 21st Food and Wine Festival. This will be the longest festival to date. I decided to change my dates so that I could spend a few days at enjoying the festival. This trip will be the best of both tavels. Spending a few days with friends and additional time exploring and enjoying Walt Disney World solo.

Yes, I do enjoy Disney solo.
