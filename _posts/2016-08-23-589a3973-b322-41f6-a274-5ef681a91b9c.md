# Planning an Artist Date

After reading 5 Reasons to Embrace Alone Time & Take Yourself on an Artist Date by Martha Brettschneider I decided to plan an artistic date during this trip.

Typically while on vacation I dress very casual. This trip the plan will to pack business casual pants and shirt. It is still a vagcation and Florida and I still want to be comfortable. Before leaving for my date I will leave my phone and use wait for it...a watch.

The first stop will be to partake in an adult beverage at the AbracadaBar. Next will be dinner at the Flying Fish. I am looking forward to dinner here after reading all the amazing reviews. After what I hope will be an incredible meal it will time off to Epcot for the fireworks.

Epcot will be open late the night of my artistic date so the plan will be take in the sights and sounds after the fireworks. The night will end with a stop at the dueling piano bar Jellyrolls.
